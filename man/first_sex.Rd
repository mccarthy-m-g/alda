\description{
A subset of data from Capaldi, Crosby, and Stoolmiller (1996) measuring the
grade year of first sexual intercourse in a sample of 180 at-risk
heterosexual adolescent males. Adolescent males were followed from Grade 7 up
to Grade 12 or until they reported having had sexual intercourse for the
first time.

\note{
Capaldi, Crosby, and Stoolmiller's (1996) original sample consisted of 182
adolescent males after applying exclusion criteria for analysis; Singer and
Willett (2003) excluded an additional two males from the data who reported
having anal intercourse with another male.
