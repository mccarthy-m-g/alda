\note{
At the request of the researchers, Singer and Willett (2003) did not provide
the data from Burchinal, Campbell, Bryant, Wasik, and Ramey's (1997) in order
to ensure the privacy of the study's participants. However, the data provided
here has been simulated to have similar statistical properties to their study
in order to match the estimates and figures presented in the text as best as
possible.
